I'm PansyGum, and I can be contacted on Discord at PansyGum#9029 or on DeviantArt at PansyGumPKMN

I based a lot of these sprites off of art created by other artists, if you use any of them please be sure to credit the correct people accordingly!

Jess Jackdaw (Twitter: https://twitter.com/jessjackdaw?lang=en , Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/JessJackdaw/) designed and drew the following Pokemon:
	- Amacorala
	- Solacor
	- Dunymph
	- Dunrago
	- Gireamer
	- Nitemarig
	- Egoelk
	- Moosid
	- Suprago
	
Travis on the PokeCommunity forums did the excellent backsprites for Nitemarig and Gireamer, because I find backspriting to be a generally miserable endeavor.

WolfPP on the PokeCommunity Discord did ALL of the beautiful overworld sprites!!

Nimbeon and Titaneon came from an anonymous "leak" of new Eeveelutions that were supposedly going to be in Sword+Shield. Of course, it was a hoax, but still great designs. If anyone knows who the artist is, please let me know so I can credit them accordingly!

The non-fakemon sprites are either ones I did for practice or because I felt like the original sprites were boring. They're mostly inspired by art from Pokemon cards.

WolfPP, Travis, Wednesday, and many others on the PokeCommunity Discord provided helpful feedback and criticism to help a lot of these sprites be great.
