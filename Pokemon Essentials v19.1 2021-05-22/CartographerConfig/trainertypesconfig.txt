# This file contains some extra info the generator uses when placing specific trainer types.
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                    
# Format:
#
# <id>,<min level>,<max level>,<class>
#
# <id> - should match the trainer's ID in PBS/trainertypes.txt
#
# <min level> - the minimum level area/route that this trainer can appear on. Default 1.
#
# <max level> - the maximum level area/route that this rainer can appear on. Default 100.
#
# <class> - The type of trainer. Valid options:
#	TRAINER - The basic kind of trainer. Will be placed randomly on routes (must have trainerpokemon.txt data)
#	SWIMMING - A swimming trainer which is placed on water. (must have trainerpokemon.txt data)
#	DOUBLE - A trainer type for double battles. These are not yet placed anywhere by the generator.
#	LEADER - Not yet generated, but will be used for Gym Leaders.
#	ELITEFOUR - Not yet generated, but will be used for Elite Four members.
#	CHAMPION - Not yet generated, but will be used for the Champion battle.
#	RIVAL - Designates the Rival(s). Not currently used.
#	PROFESSOR - Designates the Professor(s). Not currently used.
#	GRUNT - Designates Grunts for any antagonistic team or group. Not currently used.
#	BOSS - Leader of any antagonistic team or group. Not currently used.
#	PLAYER - Any trainer type just used for players. Not currently used.
#	NONE - Designation that this trainer type should not be used for anything by the generator.
# By default, if a trainer type has no data in this file, it will pick a class of "NONE". However, 
# if it has no entry in this file but has a corresponding file in the "trainerpokemon" folder, 
# it will instead take a default type of TRAINER.
